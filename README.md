In collaboration with a team of six peers during my Software Engineering I class, we successfully developed a student library management system tailored for library workers. My primary responsibilities included designing the business model and implementing the graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing. Despite facing a tight deadline of 2 weeks from initial brainstorming to final product delivery, our project showcased essential functionalities such as updating the book catalog, managing book inventory, patron search functionality, and report generation. However, due to time constraints, two functionalities remain unfinished. We recognized the potential for further enhancement through database integration.
